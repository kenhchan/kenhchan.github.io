#About Me 

My name is Ken Chan. 

My friend [Dan](http://www.therisingsea.org/) got me involved in [Metauni](https://metauni.org/). We went through [Book 1 of Euclid's Elements](https://metauni.org/posts/events/seminar-euclid). 

We'll be teaching an [algebraic geometry class](https://metauni.org/mag/) in June 2022. 

Here are some [papers](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Chan%2C+Kenneth&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50) I've written. 

I also work as a Data Scientist. Connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenhchan/).
